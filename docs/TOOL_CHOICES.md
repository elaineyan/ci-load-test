# Tool Selection Rationale

## Core Stack Choices

### KinD (Kubernetes in Docker)
**Why chosen**: 
- Lightweight and fast for CI environments
- No cloud provider dependencies
- Perfect for testing and development
- Excellent GitHub Actions integration
- Supports multi-node clusters

### NGINX Ingress Controller
**Why chosen**:
- Most widely used ingress controller
- Excellent performance characteristics
- Strong community support
- Comprehensive documentation
- Well-supported on KinD

### Kustomize for Configuration Management
**Why chosen over Helm**:
- Native Kubernetes tool (no extra dependencies)
- Better for configuration management than full application deployment
- Simpler learning curve
- Avoids template complexity for simple use cases
- GitOps friendly

### Prometheus + Grafana Monitoring
**Why chosen**:
- Industry standard for Kubernetes monitoring
- Rich metrics collection capabilities
- Powerful query language (PromQL)
- Excellent visualization with Grafana
- Large ecosystem of exporters

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)
**Why chosen**:
- Native Kubernetes auto-scaling solution
- Integrates seamlessly with Metrics Server
- Supports multiple metrics (CPU, memory)
- Configurable scaling policies

### Hey Load Testing Tool
**Why chosen**:
- Simple and effective HTTP load testing
- Written in Go (consistent with our tech stack)
- Provides comprehensive metrics
- Easy to install and use
- Lightweight and fast

## CI/CD Approach

### GitHub Actions
**Why chosen**:
- Native GitHub integration
- Excellent Kubernetes support
- Large ecosystem of actions
- Free for public repositories
- Easy to debug with live logs

### GitOps Ready Architecture
**Designed for future migration to**:
- Argo CD for production deployments
- Flux CD for continuous delivery
- Terraform for infrastructure as code
- Automated promotion between environments

## Alternative Considerations

### Considered but not chosen:
- **Helm**: Too complex for this simple use case
- **Locust**: More complex than needed for basic load testing
- **k6**: Commercial solution with free tier, but hey is simpler
- **Jenkins**: GitHub Actions provides better integration
- **Traefik**: NGINX is more widely adopted for ingress

## Future Evolution

This toolset allows for easy evolution to:
1. Multi-cluster deployments
2. Advanced monitoring with custom metrics
3. Canary deployments with HPA
4. Service mesh integration (Istio/Linkerd)
5. Custom metrics for HPA
